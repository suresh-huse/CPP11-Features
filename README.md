C++11 Features explained in Visual Studio 2019 Project.

*Start with the Main Function of C++11Features.cpp*

Open the solution in Visual Studio 2019 and build the solution.

Dont forget to make Project Properties as below.

*C/C++ > Language >  C++ Language Standard > ISO C++ Latest Draft Standard (/std:c++latest)* 

*Keep stdafx.h file at the project folder.*

You can debug one by one feature and understand. Try new examples for your better understanding.
